# Final Year Project Max/MSP Prototype

A project to prototype audio descriptor driven granular sound mosaicing.
Written in Max/MSP and was created as a prototype to test the effects of matching audio grains using different descriptor analysis.
The full project will now be reimplemented in the SPPySound project with a number of improvments needed to produce the final product
